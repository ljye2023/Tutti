# Build & SNVMe Testing Guide

This document has two parts:

1. **Build** — how to prepare the environment and compile Tutti plus the snvme kernel module.
2. **SNVMe Testing** — how to use the smoke-test suite under `backends/local/kernel_modules/test/` to validate the snvme driver, climbing from the safest test to the most destructive.

> Any concrete PCI BDF (e.g. `0000:e3:00.0`), disk mount point, etc. shown below is an **example / host-specific** value. Confirm the right one on your own host with the tooling in [Step 4](#step-4--pick-a-test-device); don't copy it blindly.

All paths are relative to the project root unless stated otherwise.

# Part 1 — Build

## 1.1 Prepare the environment

Use `scripts/prepare_env.sh` for one-shot dependency setup. The script:

- Installs `protobuf` / `gRPC` / `uuid` and friends per distro (Debian/Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS/TencentOS/Fedora/openSUSE/Arch); when system packages are unavailable it falls back to building `grpc` + `yaml-cpp` via vcpkg.
- Generates `CMakePresets.json` in the project root (**machine-generated, gitignored, do not commit**).

```bash
bash scripts/prepare_env.sh            # optional: -j N for parallelism
```

Common environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `VCPKG_ROOT` | vcpkg install path (default `third_pkgs/vcpkg`) |

## 1.2 Build Tutti


```bash

# setup MACA path
export MACA_PATH="/opt/maca"

# cu-bridge
export CUCC_PATH="${MACA_PATH}/tools/cu-bridge"
export CUDA_PATH="${HOME}/cu-bridge/CUDA_DIR"
export CUCC_CMAKE_ENTRY=2

# update PATH
export PATH=${MACA_PATH}/mxgpu_llvm/bin:${MACA_PATH}/bin:${CUCC_PATH}/tools:${CUCC_PATH}/bin:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MACA_PATH}/lib:${MACA_PATH}/ompi/lib:${MACA_PATH}/mxgpu_llvm/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

cd build
/opt/maca/tools/cu-bridge/tools/cmake_maca .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/Tutti/third_pkgs/grpc"  -DSNVME_KERNEL_VERSION=5.15.0-public
/opt/maca/tools/cu-bridge/tools/make_maca nvmeservice_daemon_example
```

Available build type: `default` (RelWithDebInfo) / `debug` / `release` / `system` (use system packages, no vcpkg toolchain). List them all with `cmake --list-presets`.

### snvme baseline auto-selection

The snvme kernel module is maintained per kernel baseline under `backends/local/kernel_modules/snvme-<tag>/`, e.g.:

- `snvme-5.15.0-public` — upstream 5.15.0

CMake matches the baseline against `uname -r` by default; you can also set it explicitly with `-DSNVME_KERNEL_VERSION=<tag>`.

## 1.3 Install the snvme kernel module

Build artifacts land in `build/module/` (`snvme-core.ko` + `snvme.ko`). Install from the build directory:

```bash
cd build && make insmod
```

Check that it installed cleanly:

```bash
$ lsmod | grep snvme
snvme                 217088  0
snvme_core            106496  1 snvme
```

To unload / reload, use `make rmmod` or the `scripts/reset_snvme.sh` helper (see [Part 2 Step 2](#step-2--rebuild--reload-the-module-only-after-editing-driver-code)).

## 1.4 Build the test code

```bash
cd backends/local/kernel_modules/test
make -j$(nproc)
```

The test binaries depend on the SNVMe UAPI header `backends/local/nvme/libnvm/include/ioctl.h` (already pulled in via `-I` by the Makefile). The role of each binary is described in [Part 2 Step 3](#step-3--build-the-test-binaries).

---

# Part 2 — SNVMe Testing

## Mental model

SNVMe exposes three kinds of `/dev` objects:

| Path | What | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dev/snvm_control` | factory entry (1 per module) | bind/unbind a PCI device, create per-ctrl chrdev |
| `/dev/ssnvme<N>` | per-controller char dev (**double s**) | BAR0 mmap + all queue ioctls |
| `/dev/snvme<X>n<Y>` | block device (**single s**) | normal mount target, appears after bind |

Testing climbs a ladder of 6 binaries, **safest → most destructive**. Golden rule: **run `snvme_smoke` first; only move up a rung after the one below passes.**

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

```bash
uname -r                                                  # 5.15.x → matches the snvme-5.15.0-public baseline
grep CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE /boot/config-$(uname -r)     # "not set" → unsigned .ko loads fine
lsmod | grep snvme                                        # snvme + snvme_core loaded
ls -l /dev/snvm_control                                   # exists, mode 0666
```

If all four pass you can skip straight to [Step 3](#Step-3--Build-the-test-binaries). Steps 1–2 are only needed when you've changed driver code and have to rebuild.

---

## Step 1 — (Re)build the module (only after editing driver code)

The `.ko`s were built in Part 1 under `build/module/`. After changing driver code, rebuild:

```bash
cmake --build --preset default --target modules
# or by hand:
cd build/module && make
```

## Step 2 — Rebuild / reload the module (only after editing driver code)

> ⚠️ **Hard rule: after any driver change you must reload the `.ko`.** The smoke binaries embed `_IOC_SIZE`-derived ioctl numbers; a stale module returns `-ENOTTY` on valid requests.

Recommended: use the project script (fail-fast — it unbinds first, checks for fd holders, then rmmod/insmod):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/reset_snvme.sh            # unbind + rmmod + insmod
# rmmod only, no reload:           scripts/reset_snvme.sh --no-insmod
# SIGKILL processes holding /dev/snvm*: scripts/reset_snvme.sh --force-cleanup
```

---

## Step 3 — Build the test binaries

```bash
cd backends/local/kernel_modules/test
make
```

This builds 6 tests + 1 reset helper:

| Binary | Binds? | Writes? | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `snvme_smoke` | no | no | libc-only UAPI smoke: chrdev create/remove + `NVM_MAP_HOST_MEMORY` + BAR0 mmap |
| `snvme_smoke_qgroup` | no | no | queue-group lifecycle (create/destroy + fd-close cascade) |
| `snvme_smoke_gpu` | no/yes | no | adds `NVM_MAP_DEVICE_MEMORY` / p2p path (built only if `nvcc` is on `$PATH`) |
| `snvme_smoke_addq` | **yes** | no | B3 `NVM_ADD_USER_QUEUE` end-to-end (Create I/O CQ+SQ + cascade destroy) |
| `snvme_smoke_recycle` | **yes** | no | `NVM_RAW_ADMIN_CMD` pass-through: Delete+Create I/O SQ/CQ recycle |
| `snvme_smoke_io` | **yes** | **yes** | B3 CPU end-to-end, 23 phases, byte-by-byte verification, **writes LBA** |
| `snvme_ubind` | — | no | owner-side reset helper: `SNVM_DEVICE_UNBIND` + `SNVM_CHRDEV_REMOVE` |

---

## Step 4 — Pick a test device

Inspect local nvme disks and the GPU↔NVMe topology distance, and pick a **throwaway** disk:

```bash
sudo bash scripts/pci_topology_check.sh
```

**The following test will destroy the data on the disk; please ensure that no important data remains on the disk.**

The rest of this guide uses a `TGT` variable for the chosen BDF:

```bash
export TGT=0000:e3:00.0     # ← replace with your own target BDF
```

---

## Step 5 — SAFE tests (no bind, won't disturb any disk)

These exercise only the UAPI and won't detach the in-tree `nvme` driver — safe even on a production host:

```bash
cd backends/local/kernel_modules/test

# 5a. libc-only UAPI smoke: chrdev create/remove + NVM_MAP_HOST_MEMORY + BAR0 mmap
sudo ./snvme_smoke        $TGT

# 5b. queue-group lifecycle (create/destroy + fd-close cascade), no bind
sudo ./snvme_smoke_qgroup $TGT
```

Each exits **0** on success. A failure prints `[FAIL] step=<N> ... errno=<E>` and stops.

---

## Step 6 — DESTRUCTIVE tests (bind required)

> 🛑 **These detach the in-tree `nvme` driver, and `snvme_smoke_io` WRITES to LBA. Use a throwaway controller only.**

Climb the rungs in order:

```bash
# 6a. B3 bind + ADD_USER_QUEUE end-to-end (with host rings; binds, no LBA writes)
sudo ./snvme_smoke_addq    $TGT

# 6b. NVM_RAW_ADMIN_CMD pass-through: Delete+Create I/O SQ/CQ recycle (binds)
sudo ./snvme_smoke_recycle $TGT

# 6c. The big one — B3 CPU end-to-end, 23 phases:
#     PRP1 / PRP1+PRP2 / PRP_List / SGL (auto-skipped on PRP-only devices) + SQ-tail-wrap,
#     byte-by-byte data verification on every IO. WRITES TO DISK.
sudo ./snvme_smoke_io      $TGT
```

`snvme_smoke_io` returning 0 is the **authoritative CPU-side gate** — it's what catches the vaddr-mask and cap-after-MSI-X regressions.

### If 6a or 6c fails with "no room for user queues"

`snvme_smoke_addq` and `snvme_smoke_io` cap kernel-side IOQs to 36 by default (`NVM_SET_KERNEL_IOQ_CAP`), reserving the rest of the controller's grant for user queues. Some controllers grant few total IOQs; in that case the default cap ≥ the grant, the kernel consumes every queue, and `NVM_ADD_USER_QUEUE` fails.

Fix: set `SNVME_TEST_KERNEL_IOQ_CAP` to a value strictly less than the controller's grant before running:

```bash
# Check how many IOQs the controller actually granted (look for max_user_qid):
sudo ./snvme_smoke_addq $TGT

sudo ./snvme_ubind $TGT
```

```bash
# If max_user_qid == 0 (no room), re-run with a smaller cap.
# Example for a 31-queue controller — cap at 16 to leave 15 for userspace:
SNVME_TEST_KERNEL_IOQ_CAP=16 sudo ./snvme_smoke_addq $TGT
SNVME_TEST_KERNEL_IOQ_CAP=16 sudo ./snvme_smoke_io   $TGT
```

---

## Step 7 — GPU tests (only if the NVIDIA driver is loaded)

Skip this on a host with no GPU (no `nvidia-smi`). On a GPU host:

```bash
# safe (no bind) — adds the NVM_MAP_DEVICE_MEMORY / p2p path
sudo ./snvme_smoke_gpu --gpu 0 $TGT

# destructive, the authoritative B3 GPU gate: 4 full alloc/free rounds
sudo ./snvme_smoke_gpu --gpu 0 --rounds 4 $TGT
```

---

## Step 8 — Cleanup & recovery

After a clean run the binaries unbind themselves. If a test **dies mid-run** (e.g. `kill -9`), the controller can be left half-bound. Reset it with the prebuilt helper:

```bash
sudo ./snvme_ubind $TGT          # SNVM_DEVICE_UNBIND + SNVM_CHRDEV_REMOVE
```

To hand the block device back to in-tree nvme:

```bash
sudo ./snvme_ubind $TGT
echo $TGT | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvme/bind 2>/dev/null
```

A full reset (unbind all snvme controllers + reload the module) is also available via `scripts/reset_snvme.sh`.
